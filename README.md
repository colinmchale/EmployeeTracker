## Description  
This backend application was made to keep track of an employee database as a company continues to evolve and potentially add more departments, roles, and employees. There are options in the application to look at all departments, all roles with their related salaries and departments in which they belong to. Another option is to view all employees along with their repsective roles, salaries, the departments they work in and their managers they report to. Users are also granted the ability to add a department, role and employee as well as update an employee's role once the application has been started.
